You need to be on the latest v5 version before upgrading your Ghost instance to v6. Please check if this condition is met before launching this update.

If not, use the following command to update your instance to the latest v5 version:
`sudo yunohost app upgrade ghost -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/ghost_ynh/tree/latest-v5`

After that you will be able to upgrade Ghost as usual!
If the upgrade to v6 still complains about not being on the latest v5 version, please report this to the YunoHost packagers.
