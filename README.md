This is just a workaround for the latest ghost update since the last update by the ghost_ynh repo was 4 months ago.

I tried updating manually by extracting the latest ghost update to /var/www/ghost/ghost/versions changing 2 lines of code(NODEJS_VER in common.sh and version = "5.59.1" in manifest.toml, thought it would just fail but the rest of their script did the work for me. So I added a little bit more to fetch the latest ghost install from the releases page/update manifest.toml+common.sh.
